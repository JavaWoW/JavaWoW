Project Information
===================
JavaWoW is a World of Warcraft emulator built to support WotLK (Patch 3.3.5a).
It is different from most other Java projects because our coding standards are
different and strict. We do attempt to follow common conventions when it comes to
Java programming (i.e. defensive copying). To better understand our coding standards
and typical coding convention, we recommend "Effective Java (2nd Edition)" by Joshua
Bloch.

JavaWoW is released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3. Our goal
for this project is produce a stable and fully working WoW server (i.e. correct
visual mapping, line-of-sight, 3D collisions).
